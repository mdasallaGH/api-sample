# Mike's API sample and work code samples

## Explanation
### Approach
I decided to use nodeJs and import the axios module to make the api request as easy as possible. I then wanted to do some validation on the returned results using asserts.

### Pros and Cons
####
Pros - Easy to understand and use by calling the method and then being able to parse the response for validation
####
Cons - The returned jokes could be funnier...

## Install and setup in terminal
`npm install`

This will install all the necessary packages.

## Run api sample in terminal
`ts-node ./api-spec.ts`

This will run the code in the .ts file.

## Extra credit
Samples of code I wrote for my current position can be found in the folder /work-samples (this code is not meant to compile).
This code has samples of using API, UI and mobile method calls in one test spec.
