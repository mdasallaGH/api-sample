# Mike's API sample and work code samples

## Install and setup in terminal
`npm install`

This will install all the necessary packages.

## Run api sample in terminal
`ts-node ./api-spec.ts`

This will run the code in the .ts file.

## Extra credit
Samples of code I wrote for my current position can be found in the folder /work-samples (this code is not meant to compile).
This code has samples of using API, UI and mobile method calls in one test spec.
